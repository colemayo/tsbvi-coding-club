/*
Make a typing game.
Use a Text object to store a text variable that will act as the keys you are 
being tested on. 
The player will have a certain number of lives and the game will continue 
while the player has more than 0 lives remaining.

After you get the basics learning, keep track of how many keys the player 
gets right before they lose and tell them at the end.
Make the game better.
